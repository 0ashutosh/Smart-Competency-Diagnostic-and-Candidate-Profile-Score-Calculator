Data Science,"What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?","Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or groupings."
Data Science,"What is overfitting in machine learning?","Overfitting happens when a model learns noise and details from training data, performing well on training but poorly on unseen test data."

Web Development,"What is REST API?","REST API is an architectural style for building APIs that use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to perform operations on resources."
Web Development,"What is AJAX?","AJAX allows web pages to update asynchronously by exchanging data with the server without reloading the page."
Web Development,"What is DOM in JavaScript?","The DOM (Document Object Model) represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree that can be modified using JavaScript."
Web Development,"What are media queries in CSS?","Media queries allow applying different CSS styles depending on device screen size or characteristics."
Web Development,"What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?","SQL databases are relational and use structured queries, while NoSQL databases are non-relational, flexible, and can store unstructured data."
Web Development,"What is cross-site scripting (XSS)?","XSS is a security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users."
Web Development,"What is CSRF?","Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack where a user is tricked into performing unwanted actions on a web application they are authenticated in."
